## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- None yet.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1-2: IPC bottleneck on terminal data streaming — must batch PTY output from day one (16ms window)
- Phase 2: WebGL context exhaustion — must implement context budget (WebGL only for visible panes)
- Phase 2: PTY/xterm.js resize race condition — must debounce at 150-200ms
- Phase 4: git2 worktree API edge cases — validate against locked worktrees, detached HEAD, bare repos
- Phase 5: Agent binary name patterns may have shifted — verify before building known_agents list
